    <p>Hey there! I'm Sreya, an enthusiastic explorer of the fascinating world of computer science. Currently, I'm on a
        thrilling journey as a master's student, diving deep into the captivating realm of Artificial Intelligence at
        the <a href="https://www.usc.edu">University of Southern California</a>. But hey, my path to USC wasn't an
        ordinary one!</p>

    <p>Picture this: I embarked on an exhilarating academic adventure that took me across continents and through
        diverse cultures. I earned my stripes in computer science by acquiring a double degree from two incredible
        institutions—Christ University in Bangalore, India, and Kyungpook National University in Daegu, South Korea.
        Talk about a truly global education!</p>

    <p>Now, let me humblebrag a bit—I proudly graduated with the third rank in my department during my bachelor's
        studies. Algorithms are my jam, and I have an insatiable curiosity for unraveling the intricacies of computer
        vision. There's something magical about the way machines perceive and interpret the visual world, don't you
        think?</p>

    <p>But hold on, there's more to me than just lines of code and cutting-edge tech! If you want to win me over
        instantly, just introduce me to a furry, four-legged friend. Yep, you guessed it—I'm absolutely head over paws
        for dogs! So, expect to find the occasional cute doggo picture popping up on my digital playground.</p>

    <p>So, whether you're a fellow tech enthusiast or a wanderer looking to connect, join me on this adventure as we
        unravel the possibilities of artificial intelligence, one line of code at a time.</p>
